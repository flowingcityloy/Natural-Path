## Description

This application is designed for a real business -- YanBian Acumedic Clinic. The owner, Ms. Cui is second generation of L.Ac, OMD. The clinic was founded by Ms. Xu about forty years ago, and it's served many patients through acupuncture and Chinese herb medicine to get well. However, they are not utilizing current technologies, such as webpage to assist the business. As a web developer, with the heart of helping out, we decided to build this webpage for them to shorten the time of making appointments, keeping records of patients, and expand the possibilities of online shopping.
